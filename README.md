## Ruby Assessment

### Word Frequency and Uniqueness Count
==========

The goal of this assessment is to add the methods `unique_word_count` and `word_frequency_count` to the String class.

1. Study the tests in `spec/word_count_spec.rb` to figure out what you need to do
1. Add your implementation of the methods to the file `lib/word_count.rb`
1. Run 'rspec' to run the tests.
1. Run the `interactive_word_count.rb` to try it.

Happy Coding!!
